usage: juju add-machine [options] [<container>:machine | <container> | ssh:[user@]host]
purpose: start a new, empty machine and optionally a container, or add a container to a machine

options:
--constraints  (= )
    additional machine constraints
-e, --environment (= "joyent")
    juju environment to operate in
--series (= "")
    the charm series

If no container is specified, a new machine will be
provisioned.  If a container is specified, a new machine will be provisioned
with that container.

To add a container to an existing machine, use the <container>:<machinenumber>
format.

When adding a new machine, you may specify constraints for the machine to be
provisioned.  Constraints cannot be combined with deploying a container to an
existing machine.

Currently, the only supported container type is lxc.

Machines are created in a clean state and ready to have units deployed.

This command also supports manual provisioning of existing machines via SSH. The
target machine must be able to communicate with the API server, and be able to
access the environment storage.

Examples:
   juju add-machine                      (starts a new machine)
   juju add-machine lxc                  (starts a new machine with an lxc container)
   juju add-machine lxc:4                (starts a new lxc container on machine 4)
   juju add-machine --constraints mem=8G (starts a machine with at least 8GB RAM)
   juju add-machine ssh:user@10.10.0.3   (manually provisions a machine with ssh)
