This copies the Juju tools tarball from the official tools store (located
at https://streams.canonical.com/juju) into your environment.
This is generally done when you want Juju to be able to run without having to
access the Internet. Alternatively you can specify a local directory as source.

Sometimes this is because the environment does not have public access,
and sometimes you just want to avoid having to access data outside of
the local cloud.
