<charm url> can be a charm URL, or an unambiguously condensed form of it;
the following forms are accepted:

For cs:precise/mysql
  cs:precise/mysql
  precise/mysql

For cs:~user/precise/mysql
  cs:~user/precise/mysql

There is no default series, so one must be provided explicitly when
informing a charm URL. If the URL isn't provided, an attempt will be
made to infer it from the current branch push URL.
