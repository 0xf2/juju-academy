usage: juju set-constraints [options] [key=[value] ...]
purpose: set constraints on the environment or a service

options:
-e, --environment (= "joyent")
    juju environment to operate in
-s, --service (= "")
    set service constraints

set-constraints sets machine constraints on the system, which are used as the
default constraints for all new machines provisioned in the environment (unless
overridden).  You can also set constraints on a specific service by using juju 
set-constraints <service>. 

Constraints set on a service are combined with environment constraints for
commands (such as juju deploy) that provision machines for services.  Where
environment and service constraints overlap, the service constraints take
precedence.

Examples:

   set-constraints mem=8G                         (all new machines in the environment must have at least 8GB of RAM)
   set-constraints --service wordpress mem=4G     (all new wordpress machines can ignore the 8G constraint above, and require only 4G)
