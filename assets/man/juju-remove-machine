usage: juju destroy-machine [options] <machine> ...
purpose: destroy machines

options:

    juju environment to operate in
--force  (= false)

Machines that are responsible for the environment cannot be destroyed. Machines
running units or containers can only be destroyed with the --force flag; doing
so will also destroy all those units and containers without giving them any
opportunity to shut down cleanly.
