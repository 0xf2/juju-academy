Start by generating a generic configuration file for Juju, using the command:

  juju init

This will create the '~/.juju/' directory (or $JUJU_HOME, if set) if it doesn't
already exist and generate a file, 'environments.yaml' in that directory.

Configuring the EC2 environment requires telling Juju about your AWS access key
and secret key. To do this, you can either set the 'AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID' and
'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY' environment variables[1] (as usual for other EC2 tools)
or you can add access-key and secret-key options to your environments.yaml.
These are already in place in the generated config, you just need to uncomment
them out. For example:

  sample_ec2:
    type: ec2
    # access-key: YOUR-ACCESS-KEY-GOES-HERE
    # secret-key: YOUR-SECRET-KEY-GOES-HERE

See the EC2 provider documentation[2] for more options.

Note If you already have an AWS account, you can determine your access key by
visiting your account page[3], clicking "Security Credentials" and then clicking
"Access Credentials". You'll be taken to a table that lists your access keys and
has a "show" link for each access key that will reveal the associated secret
key.

And that's it, you're ready to go!
