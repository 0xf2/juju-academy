usage: juju deploy [options] <charm name> [<service name>]
purpose: deploy a new service

options:
--config  (= )
    path to yaml-formatted service config
--constraints  (= )
    set service constraints
-e, --environment (= "joyent")
    juju environment to operate in
--exclude-networks (= "")
    disable networks for service
-n, --num-units  (= 1)
    number of service units to deploy for principal charms
--networks (= "")
    enable networks for service
--repository (= "")
    local charm repository
--to (= "")
    the machine or container to deploy the unit in, bypasses constraints
-u, --upgrade  (= false)
    increment local charm directory revision (DEPRECATED)

<charm name> can be a charm URL, or an unambiguously condensed form of it;
assuming a current series of "precise", the following forms will be accepted:

For cs:precise/mysql
  mysql
  precise/mysql

For cs:~user/precise/mysql
  cs:~user/mysql

The current series is determined first by the default-series environment
setting, followed by the preferred series for the charm in the charm store.

In these cases, a versioned charm URL will be expanded as expected (for example,
mysql-33 becomes cs:precise/mysql-33).

However, for local charms, when the default-series is not specified in the
environment, one must specify the series. For example:
  local:precise/mysql

<service name>, if omitted, will be derived from <charm name>.

Constraints can be specified when using deploy by specifying the --constraints
flag.  When used with deploy, service-specific constraints are set so that later
machines provisioned with add-unit will use the same constraints (unless changed
by set-constraints).

Charms can be deployed to a specific machine using the --to argument.

Like constraints, service-specific network requirements can be
specified with --networks and --exclude-networks arguments, both can
take a comma-delimited list of provider-specific network names/labels.
These instruct juju to ensure to add all the networks specified with
--networks to all new machines deployed to host units of the service
and to ensure none of the networks in --exclude-networks are added to
the service's machines. Not supported on all providers.

Examples:
   juju deploy mysql --to 23       (Deploy to machine 23)
   juju deploy mysql --to 24/lxc/3 (Deploy to lxc container 3 on host machine 24)
   juju deploy mysql --to lxc:25   (Deploy to a new lxc container on host machine 25)
   
   juju deploy mysql -n 5 --constraints mem=8G (deploy 5 instances of mysql with at least 8 GB of RAM each)

   juju deploy mysql --networks=storage,mynet --exclude-networks=logging
