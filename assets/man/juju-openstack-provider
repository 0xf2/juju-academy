Start by generating a generic configuration file for Juju, using the command:

  juju init

This will create the '~/.juju/' directory (or $JUJU_HOME, if set) if it doesn't
already exist and generate a file, 'environments.yaml' in that directory.

Here's an example OpenStack configuration:

  sample_openstack:
    type: openstack

    # Specifies whether the use of a floating IP address is required to
    # give the nodes a public IP address. Some installations assign public
    # IP addresses by default without requiring a floating IP address.
    # use-floating-ip: false

    # Specifies whether new machine instances should have the "default"
    # Openstack security group assigned.
    # use-default-secgroup: false

    # Usually set via the env variable OS_AUTH_URL, but can be specified here
    # auth-url: https://yourkeystoneurl:443/v2.0/

    # The following are used for userpass authentication (the default)
    # auth-mode: userpass

    # Usually set via the env variable OS_USERNAME, but can be specified here
    # username: <your username>

    # Usually set via the env variable OS_PASSWORD, but can be specified here
    # password: <secret>

    # Usually set via the env variable OS_TENANT_NAME, but can be specified here
    # tenant-name: <your tenant name>

    # Usually set via the env variable OS_REGION_NAME, but can be specified here
    # region: <your region>

If you have set the described OS_* environment variables, you only need "type:".
