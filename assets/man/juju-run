-e, --environment (= "joyent")
    juju environment to operate in
--format  (= smart)

--machine  (= )
    one or more machine ids
-o, --output (= "")

--service  (= )

--timeout  (= 5m0s)
    how long to wait before the remote command is considered to have failed
--unit  (= )
    one or more unit ids

Run the commands on the specified targets.

Targets are specified using either machine ids, service names or unit
names.  At least one target specifier is needed.

Multiple values can be set for --machine, --service, and --unit by using
comma separated values.

If the target is a machine, the command is run as the "ubuntu" user on
the remote machine.

If the target is a service, the command is run on all units for that
service. For example, if there was a service "mysql" and that service
had two units, "mysql/0" and "mysql/1", then
  --service mysql
is equivalent to
  --unit mysql/0,mysql/1

Commands run for services or units are executed in a 'hook context' for
the unit.

--all is provided as a simple way to run the command on all the machines
in the environment.  If you specify --all you cannot provide additional
targets.
