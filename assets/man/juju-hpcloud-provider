Start by generating a generic configuration file for Juju, using the command:

  juju init

This will create the '~/.juju/' directory (or $JUJU_HOME, if set) if it doesn't
already exist and generate a file, 'environments.yaml' in that directory.

HP Cloud is an Openstack cloud provider.  To deploy to it, use an openstack
environment type for Juju, which would look something like this:

  sample_hpcloud:
    type: openstack
    tenant-name: "juju-project1"
    auth-url: https://region-a.geo-1.identity.hpcloudsvc.com:35357/v2.0/
    auth-mode: userpass
    username: "xxxyour-hpcloud-usernamexxx"
    password: "xxxpasswordxxx"
    region: az-1.region-a.geo-1
