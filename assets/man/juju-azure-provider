Start by generating a generic configuration file for Juju, using the command:

  juju init

This will create the '~/.juju/' directory (or $JUJU_HOME, if set) if it doesn't
already exist and generate a file, 'environments.yaml' in that directory.

A generic Windows Azure environment looks like this:

  sample_azure:
    type: azure

    # Location for instances, e.g. West US, North Europe.
    location: West US

    # http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure
    # Windows Azure Management info.
    management-subscription-id: 886413e1-3b8a-5382-9b90-0c9aee199e5d
    management-certificate-path: /home/me/azure.pem

    # Windows Azure Storage info.
    storage-account-name: juju0useast0

    # Override OS image selection with a fixed image for all deployments.
    # Most useful for developers.
    # force-image-name: b39f27a8b8c64d52b05eac6a62ebad85__Ubuntu-13_10-amd64-server-DEVELOPMENT-20130713-Juju_ALPHA-en-us-30GB

    # Pick a simplestreams stream to select OS images from: daily or released
    # images, or any other stream available on simplestreams.  Leave blank for
    # released images.
    # image-stream: ""

This is the environments.yaml configuration file needed to run on Windows Azure.
You will need to set the management-subscription-id, management-certificate-
path, and storage-account-name.

Note: Other than location, the defaults are recommended, but can be updated to
your preference.
