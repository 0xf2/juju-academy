usage: juju add-unit [options] <service name>
purpose: add one or more units of an already-deployed service

options:
-e, --environment (= "joyent")
    juju environment to operate in
-n, --num-units  (= 1)
    number of service units to add
--to (= "")
    the machine or container to deploy the unit in, bypasses constraints

Adding units to an existing service is a way to scale out an environment by
deploying more instances of a service.  Add-unit must be called on services that
have already been deployed via juju deploy.  

By default, services are deployed to newly provisioned machines.  Alternatively,
service units can be added to a specific existing machine using the --to
argument.

Examples:
 juju add-unit mysql -n 5          (Add 5 mysql units on 5 new machines)
 juju add-unit mysql --to 23       (Add a mysql unit to machine 23)
 juju add-unit mysql --to 24/lxc/3 (Add unit to lxc container 3 on host machine 24)
 juju add-unit mysql --to lxc:25   (Add unit to a new lxc container on host machine 25)
